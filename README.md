> A desktop recipe management application developed in C# using Windows Forms in my second year of study.

## 📱 Overview

Grub Hub is a user-friendly desktop application that allows users to:

- Create, view, scale, and delete recipes
- Group recipes into custom menus
- Visually analyze food groups using pie charts
- View nutritional information
- Understand food group classifications

This app was developed for my **PROG6221 Programming module** and demonstrates fundamental object-oriented programming, GUI design, input validation, and modular application structure in C# using WinForms.
